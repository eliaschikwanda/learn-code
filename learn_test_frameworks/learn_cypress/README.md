Hello folks, I'm learning (I learnt) cypress using a YouTube channel (https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhW3qG5bs-L9LTfxZ5LEBiM1WFfvX3dJo) by 
Raghav. The tutorial has been a useful intro to cypress and I will keep anything I wanna remeber on this page as my cheatsheet.

<b>Assertions in Cypress</b>
<p>We have two types of assertions in cypress Explicit and Implicit</p>
<p>For explicit we use the commands `and()` and `should()`</p>
<p>For implicit we use the command `assert()` and `expect()`</p>
