# This is a few notes from code with mosh lecture on docker

- Docker is an application for building, running, and shipping applications.
- A container is an isolated environment for running an application.
- Docker used a client server architecture, which means it has a client component
  that communicates with a server component using REST API. The server is also
  called the docker engine
- To dockerize an application you add a docker file to the app which is a plain text
  file that docker docker uses to package the information into an image.
