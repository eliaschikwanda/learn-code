# We gonna be learning React
- React is a JS library not a framework and I will be using this README to document my progress.
- I am using the codewithmosh react course to kick start my learning of react.

## Important notes and points below
- You can start the react app using either `Create Virtual App` or `Vite`
- In the directory you want your file you can use vite in the cmd as follows `npm create vite@"version"` or 
  you can use `npm create vite@latest`.
- Using vite you can create a lot of javascript apps, but in this case select React.
- To run the web app we use `npm run dev`.

### Creating components
- You can use a javascript class or a function. Functions are preferred to classes.
- It is advisable to put all components in a folder named `components` in the `src` directory.
