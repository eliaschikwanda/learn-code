# Angular Learing Recording Progress
## This is to record my progress learning Angular.

I have started learning Angular on YouTube using the channel CodeWithMosh
and this is the link to the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5E2AVpwsko&t).

### Shortcuts in Angular.
`g` - generate <br>
`c` - component <br>
`s` - service <br>
- For creating a component you use `ng g c "componet-name"`
* For creating a service you use `ng g s "service-name"`


### General Notes
- To start a new project with a traditional program structure use `ng new "app-name" --standalone false`, and for
the one with standalone structure use `ng new "app-name"`
